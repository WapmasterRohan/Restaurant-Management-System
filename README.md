# Restaurant-Management-System

The restaurant maintains Catalog for the list of food and beverage items that it provides. A
part from providing food facility at their own premises at the restaurant takes order online
through their System. Orders on phone are also entertained. To deliver the delivers we have
delivery boys. Each delivery boy is assigned to specific area code. The delivery boy canâ€™t
delivery outside the area which is not assigned to delivery boy (for every delivery boy there
can be single area assigned to that delivery boy). Customers record is maintained so that
premium customer can be awarded discount.
